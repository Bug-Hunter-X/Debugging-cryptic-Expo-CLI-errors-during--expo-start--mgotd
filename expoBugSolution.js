The solutions for cryptic Expo CLI errors are multifaceted and depend on the root cause.  There isn't a single 'fix-all' solution.

**1. Verify Project Setup:**

Thoroughly review your `app.json` and `package.json` files. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that your configuration aligns with Expo's documentation for your project SDK version. Correct any syntax errors or inconsistencies.

**2. Resolve Port Conflicts:**

Use your operating system's command-line tools (e.g., `netstat` on Windows, `lsof` on macOS/Linux) to identify processes using port 19000 or 19001. Terminate these processes before running `expo start`.

**3. Address Network Connectivity:**

Confirm you have a stable internet connection. If using a proxy or VPN, temporarily disable them to check for interference. Verify that your firewall isn't blocking Expo's communication.

**4. Reinstall Expo CLI:**

If other troubleshooting steps fail, reinstall the Expo CLI using the following commands:
```bash
npm uninstall -g expo-cli
npm install -g expo-cli
```

**5. Check for Package Conflicts:**

Examine your `package.json` dependencies for any potential conflicts. Update packages to their latest versions and resolve any dependency warnings or errors.

**6. Restart Your Computer:**

In some cases, a simple restart can resolve temporary operating system-related issues. 

**7. Examine the Error Message:**

Even seemingly nonspecific errors may contain clues. Carefully analyze the full error message.  Search online forums or the Expo documentation for similar error reports.
