# Debugging Cryptic Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates common and uncommon error scenarios encountered when using the Expo CLI's `expo start` command.  The errors are often vague and lack specific guidance, making debugging challenging. This repo provides example error cases and solutions.

## Common Error Scenarios:

* **Port Conflicts:**  Another application might be using the port Expo attempts to use (typically 19000 or 19001).
* **Network Connectivity:**  Network problems can prevent the development server from starting or communicating correctly.
* **Package Conflicts:**  Incompatible packages in your `package.json` can lead to errors.

## Uncommon Error Scenarios:

* **Operating System Limitations:**  Rare OS-specific issues (permissions, file system) may interfere with Expo.
* **Corrupted Expo CLI Installation:**  A faulty Expo CLI installation can cause unexpected errors.

## Solutions:

* **Check `package.json` and `app.json`:**  Ensure your project configuration is valid and up-to-date.
* **Identify Port Conflicts:**  Use `netstat -a -b` (Windows) or `lsof -i -P | grep -i listen` (macOS/Linux) to identify applications using port 19000 or 19001.
* **Restart your computer:** A simple restart can resolve temporary OS-related issues.
* **Reinstall the Expo CLI:** Use `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli` to reinstall a fresh copy.
* **Check your network connection:**  Verify stable internet access.
* **Examine the Expo error message carefully:** Although cryptic, there might be clues hidden within the error output.
